# Remote Control System - Minimal Dependencies
# Core functionality works with Python standard library only

# Optional: Screen capture for better performance (pillow is stable on all platforms)
pillow>=9.0.0

# EXPLICITLY AVOID PROBLEMATIC PACKAGES:
# - pynput causes evdev compilation errors on Linux cloud platforms
# - evdev is Linux-specific and fails to build on cloud environments
# 
# The system includes fallback mechanisms using Python standard library
# for input control when these packages are not available.
