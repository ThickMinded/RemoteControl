# Remote Control System - Python Dependencies
# 
# Core functionality works with Python standard library only
# These are optional dependencies for enhanced features:

# Screen capture (highly recommended for better performance)
pillow>=9.0.0

# Mouse and keyboard control (recommended for full functionality)
pynput>=1.7.0

# Note: If these dependencies fail to install or are not available,
# the system will still work using Python standard library fallbacks
# with reduced functionality (limited screen capture and basic input simulation)
